## Background

This react website was made to help consolidate my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application. It is a board-game review website where users can view existing reviews or add their own.

All reviews can be commented on, voted on and if applicable deleted or editted.

The site is hosted on Netlify and is available to view [here](https://sgm-games.netlify.app/reviews).

The source code can be viewed and downloaded from [github](https://github.com/Sgavinmills/sgm-games).
